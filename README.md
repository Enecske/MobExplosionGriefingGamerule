# MobExplosionGriefingGamerule

## Fabric

This Minecraft mods separates explosions from the `mobGriefing` gamerule.
It adds a custom gamerule, `mobExplosionGriefing` (`true` by default), which makes the explosions of **Creepers and Ghast Fireballs** not destroy blocks.

Also, the mod introduces another gamerule, `witherGriefing` (`true` by default), which makes the explosions of **Withers** not destroy blocks.

This mod only needs to be installed **server-side**.
